## A sustainability website that helps you create more business value
<br><br>

## Inspiration <br>

When it comes to sustainability in business, people often think about cutting the use of electricity or water in the company. Being an environmentally aware business considers more than just profits — it considers its impact on society and the environment. However, being a more sustainable firm also brings more opportunities, such companies will have an easier time attracting patient investors with a greater willingness to wait for the return of capital. A recent survey shows that more than 3,700 students from 29 top business schools found that the respondents were “ increasingly sorting companies into the top and bottom environmental performers with associated consequences for recruiting and compensation.” and more than 78% of students were more inclined to apply for a job with a company with excellent environmental performance. Our idea is to design a website to promote sustainability in the industry and inform the business about measures they can make. We wish to create a website that helps businesses be aware of the environmental problems, learn more about the idea, and set up their plan to become more sustainable. 



## What it does 

This website gives all the information about being more sustainable and the ways for a business to run in a more environmentally friendly way. The site also gives information about how other businesses contribute to creating a more sustainable world. With the Rank-your-business quiz, users can measure how sustainable the company is and take action.

## How we built it

We built the webpages using Html, Css and Javascript.
